# StoreScraper

Small django project to explain the use of beautifulsoup. Its main feature is the possibility to continuously scrap
e-commerce websites to check if a product has a lower price than you defined, or if a size is now available. 
Three famous brazilian shops are available: Centauro, NetShoes and Kanui. Write me to ask for support on new sites.

It is possible to deploy this project on a raspberry pi or a cloud service like heroku.
